  <h2>About this project</h2>
  <p>
    This Android project was intended to become a social app for trail-goers and really anybody who wants a cool new way to go hiking. The end product of our efforts was an app that you could authenticate using your own Google account through the Firebase API and can simply tracks you as you go down your hike path. You could then look at statistics about the path you traveled upon ending the tracking.

    This was completed a sa group project with 3 other classmates- Ryan Grabar, Brian Zimmerman, and Brock D'Amico- for the class CST-438 (Software Engineering) at California State University, Monterey Bay.

    My role within the group was to work along with Ryan and Brock on the Android side of the project while Brian was in charge of the backend server with AWS Elastic Beanstalk. My efforts on the project involved ensuring that communication with the backend server was successful and was in charge of writing all the GET and POST requests with the backend. I also made sure the login systsetm was correctly communicating with the Firebase Authentication API. On top of this, I was also in charge of writing end-to-end testing using Espresso to run live tests using an Android virtual device.
