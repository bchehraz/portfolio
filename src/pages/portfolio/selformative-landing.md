<h2>About this project</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of this website was to serve as a landing page while the product for Selformative was developed. The Selformative project was meant to be the combination of a blog and YouTube channel targeted toward anyone who is looking for useful information on how to improve their life. From diet and exercise advice to useful tools people can use to manage their busy work schedules. Selformative is aimed at helping people be their best selves.
