<h2>About this project</h2>
<p>
  This website was created to serve as a place to share my professional self- through my portfolio and blog.
  I worked on it for 3 months before its release. The project is ongoing- I plan to update frequently, with
  new projects and blog posts. Since falling in love with ReactJS and modern JavaScript, I decided to
  create this new website to put my learning into practice.
