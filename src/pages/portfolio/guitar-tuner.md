<h2>About this project</h2>
<p>
  Python (Group) Project created for CST 205 @ CSU Monterey Bay. The project is meant to listen to input from your computer's default microphone and listen to sound coming in. Technically it could work for any instrument or your voice, but the notes have been divided into the various tune sets that are specific to guitar such as E Standard, Drop D and so on.
