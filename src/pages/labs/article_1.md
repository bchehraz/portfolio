<p>Perhaps a blog is not worth it. A portfolio containing only projected-related content could suffice. Going above and beyond in my portfolio efforts may only be an extra 80% effort for only 20% gains.</p>

<h2>Here's some of the reasoning why I decided to do it anyway.</h2>

<p>Blogging may not directly give me a gain in income or a guaranteed number of followers through social media, but maybe blogging will help expand my own creativity and critical thinking. I believe the main reason why I have decided to do blogging is to be able to see information in a new perspective and to reflect on past experiences, enabling me to plan more effectively for future experiences.</p>

<p>More simply put, I have to create content not just for me, but for a potential reader. Somebody who may be trying to gain insight on a new topic or learn more about me. I have to write in a new perspective. On top of this, writing about past projects would give me better insight as to how I could be approaching future projects. Instead of letting projects become stale after completing them, what can I gain from them to become a better developer? Blogging will serve as a positive connection between past experiences and new ones. </p>

<h2>What are Code Labs?</h2>
<p>I've made the decision to start this blog called "Code Labs" where I will be sharing code snippets I find interesting, cool coding concepts, and reflections on my personal project experience. On top of this, anything I find interesting or worth writing about in the world of technology and software development, I will not hesitate to share. If there is an awesome new website to help teach new developers coding concepts, I will also share those.</p>

<p>Whatever part of the world you are visiting from right now, welcome to my portfolio/blog and thank you for stopping by!</p>
