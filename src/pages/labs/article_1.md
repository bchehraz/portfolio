<p>With all the various steps involved in building a portfolio, I had to make a decision on whether I was going to create my own blog to supplement my portfolio. Perhaps a portfolio website containing only project-related content would suffice. Maybe I do not need to go "above and beyond" and start a blog. I decided that having a coding blog would help apply some of my learning and experience in ways that could expand my knowledge, by seeing it in a new perspective. Perhaps sharing reflections upon my past projects will give me better insight into how my future projects could be improved.</p>

<h2>What are Code Labs?</h2>
<p>I decided to start this blog called "Code Labs" where I will be sharing code snippets I find interesting, cool coding concepts, and reflections on my personal project experience. I will also review awesome websites that can help anyone become a better software developer.</p>

<p>Wherever part of the world you are visiting from, welcome to my portfolio and thank you for stopping by! :) </p>
