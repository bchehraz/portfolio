{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<section>\n<h2>About this project</h2>\n<p>\n  This website was created to serve as a portfolio for myself as a software developer.\n  I worked on it for 3 months before its release. Since I want to brand myself as a\n  \"Software Developer specializing in Modern JavaScript\", I had to create a new portfolio\n  to fit the part. The website is fully built in GatsbyJS which uses ReactJS and GraphQL to provide a\n  very fast website viewing experience.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Technical Sheet</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>UI/UX Architecture</li>\n  <li>UI/UX Animations</li>\n  <li>React</li>\n  <li>Redux</li>\n  <li>Webpack</li>\n  <li>Atom</li>\n  <li>Javascript ES6</li>\n  <li>HTML5 - semantic, video, canvas</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Download the app at <a href=\"#/http://www.google.com\">HTTPS://GOOGLE.COM</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n</section>","frontmatter":{"title":"Portfolio Website","description":"Literally this portfolio website.","tags":["Mental Health","Time Management"],"startDate":"April 2018","type":"webApp","demoLink":null,"blogLink":null,"ghLink":"http://github.com/bchehraz/portfolio","duration":"Ongoing"},"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/portfolio/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/portfolio/portfolio/"}}
