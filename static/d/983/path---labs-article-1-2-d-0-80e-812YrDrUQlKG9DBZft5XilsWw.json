{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1>The Code Labs Blog</h1>\n<p>With all the various steps involved in building a portfolio, I had to make a decision on whether I was going to create my own blog to supplement my portfolio. Perhaps a portfolio website containing only project-related content would suffice. Maybe I do not need to go \"above and beyond\" and start a blog. I decided that having a blog to write about would exercise some of my critical thinking skills when it comes to coding. To see code from a different point of view. Perhaps sharing reflections upon my past projects will give me better insight into how my future projects could improve.</p>\n<h2>What are Code Labs?</h2>\n<p>I decided to start this blog called \"Code Labs\" where I will be sharing code snippets I find interesting, cool coding concepts, and reflections on my personal project experience. I will also review awesome websites that help a person become a better software developer. </p>\n<p>Wherever you are coming from and reading this right now, welcome to my portfolio and thank you for stopping by!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Code Labs Blog","date":"8 hours ago","type":"Article","featuredImage":"./featured-image.jpg","tags":null,"ghLink":null,"demoLink":null,"path":null},"fields":{"slug":"/labs/article_1/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/labs/article_1/"}}
