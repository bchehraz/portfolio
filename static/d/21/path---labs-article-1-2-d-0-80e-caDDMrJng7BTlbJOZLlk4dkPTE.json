{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>With all the various steps involved in building a portfolio, I had to make a decision on whether I was going to create my own blog to supplement my portfolio. Perhaps a portfolio website containing only project-related content would suffice. Maybe I do not need to go \"above and beyond\" and start a blog. I decided that having a coding blog would help apply some of my learning and experience in ways that could expand my knowledge, by seeing it in a new perspective. Perhaps sharing reflections upon my past projects will give me better insight into how my future projects could be improved.</p>\n<h2>What are Code Labs?</h2>\n<p>I decided to start this blog called \"Code Labs\" where I will be sharing code snippets I find interesting, cool coding concepts, and reflections on my personal project experience. I will also review awesome websites that can help anyone become a better software developer.</p>\n<p>Wherever part of the world you are visiting from, welcome to my portfolio and thank you for stopping by! :) </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Code Labs Blog","date":"9 hours ago","type":"Article","featuredImage":"./featured-image.jpg","tags":null,"ghLink":null,"demoLink":null,"path":null},"fields":{"slug":"/labs/article_1/"}},"authorPicture":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/f9866/author.jpg","srcSet":"/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/00059/author.jpg 63w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/b28a5/author.jpg 125w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/f9866/author.jpg 250w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/57d15/author.jpg 375w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/09231/author.jpg 500w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/0c5f4/author.jpg 750w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/ef592/author.jpg 2592w","sizes":"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/labs/article_1/"}}
