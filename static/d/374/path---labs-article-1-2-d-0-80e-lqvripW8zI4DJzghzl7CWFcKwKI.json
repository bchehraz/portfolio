Perhaps a portfolio website containing only project-related content would suffice. Maybe I do not need to go \"above and beyond\" and start a blog. I decided that having a coding blog would help apply some of my learning and experience in ways that could expand my knowledge, by seeing it in a new perspective. Perhaps sharing reflections upon my past projects will give me better insight into how my future projects could be improved.</p>\n<h2>What are Code Labs?</h2>\n<p>I decided to start this blog called \"Code Labs\" where I will be sharing code snippets I find interesting, cool coding concepts, and reflections on my personal project experience. I will also review awesome websites that can help anyone become a better software developer.</p>\n<p>Wherever part of the world you are visiting from, welcome to my portfolio and thank you for stopping by! :) </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Code Labs Blog","date":"2 days ago","type":"Article","featuredImage":"./featured-image.jpg","tags":null,"ghLink":null,"demoLink":null,"path":null},"fields":{"slug":"/labs/article_1/"}},"authorPicture":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/labs/article_1/"}}
