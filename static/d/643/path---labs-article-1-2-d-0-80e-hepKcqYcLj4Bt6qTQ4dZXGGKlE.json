{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Perhaps a blog is not worth it. A portfolio containing only projected-related content could suffice. Going above and beyond in my portfolio efforts may only be an extra 80% effort for only 20% gains.</p>\n<h2>Here's some of the reasoning why I decided to do it anyway.</h2>\n<p>Blogging may not directly give me a gain in income or a guaranteed number of followers through social media, but maybe blogging will help expand my own creativity and critical thinking. I believe the main reason why I have decided to do blogging is to be able to see information in a new perspective and to reflect on past experiences, enabling me to plan more effectively for future experiences.</p>\n<p>More simply put, I have to create content not just for me, but for a potential reader. Somebody who may be trying to gain insight on a new topic or learn more about myself. I have to write in a new perspective. On top of this, writing about past projects would give me better insight as to how I could be approaching future projects. Instead of letting projects become stale after completing them, what can I gain from them to become a better developer? Blogging will serve as a positive connection between past experiences and new ones. </p>\n<h2>What are Code Labs?</h2>\n<p>I've made the decision to start this blog called \"Code Labs\" where I will be sharing code snippets I find interesting, cool coding concepts, and reflections on my personal project experience. On top of this, anything I find interesting or worth writing about in the world of technology and software development, I will not hesitate to share. If there is an awesome new website to help teach new developers coding concepts, I will also share those.</p>\n<p>Whatever part of the world you are visiting from right now, welcome to my portfolio/blog and thank you for stopping by!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Code Labs Blog","date":"4 days ago","type":"Article","featuredImage":"./featured-image.jpg","tags":null,"ghLink":null,"demoLink":null,"path":null},"fields":{"slug":"/labs/article_1/"}},"authorPicture":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/a0171/author.jpg","srcSet":"/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/769ff/author.jpg 125w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/17bc3/author.jpg 250w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/a0171/author.jpg 500w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/5c34a/author.jpg 750w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/ad8d3/author.jpg 1000w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/03b52/author.jpg 1500w,\n/static/be43bf1f1e8851c41885df3ab50bfefe/2f469/author.jpg 2592w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/labs/article_1/"}}
